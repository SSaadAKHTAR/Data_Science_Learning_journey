# Task 3: Fraud Detection System

## Description
The task focuses on creating a **fraud detection system** to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using datasets like the Credit Card Fraud Dataset. This involves handling imbalanced data, training models, and creating a testing interface.

---

## Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Handle Imbalanced Data:**
  - Applied techniques like **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to balance the dataset.

### 2. Model Training
- **Algorithms Used:**
  - Trained models such as **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting**.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - **Precision, Recall, F1-Score.**

### 4. Testing Interface
- Built a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** to:
  - Input transaction data.
  - Predict whether a transaction is fraudulent.

---

## Outcome
- A Python script capable of:
  - Detecting fraudulent transactions.
  - Providing an interactive interface for real-time testing.
