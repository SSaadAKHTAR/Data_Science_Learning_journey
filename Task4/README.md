# Task 4: Predicting House Prices Using the Boston Housing Dataset

## Description
The objective is to predict house prices using the **Boston Housing Dataset** by implementing regression models from scratch. This task includes preprocessing, training, and comparing multiple regression models.

## Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Normalize Numerical Features:**
  - Scaled data to bring all numerical features to a common range.
- **Handle Missing Data:**
  - Managed null values through imputation techniques.

### 2. Model Implementation
- Built regression models **from scratch**, including:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **XGBoost**

### 3. Performance Comparison
- Evaluated models using:
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measures model prediction error.
  - **RÂ² Score:** Indicates how well the model explains variance in the target variable.

### 4. Feature Importance
- Visualized feature importance for tree-based models to identify the most influential variables.

### Model Performance
- **Report and MSE of the Models:**
