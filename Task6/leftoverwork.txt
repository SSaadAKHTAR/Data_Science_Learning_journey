Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Why? Raw text contains noise (e.g., HTML tags, special characters, stopwords) that can degrade model performance.
How?
Load the CNN/Daily Mail dataset.
Tokenize sentences and remove unnecessary characters.
Normalize text (convert to lowercase, remove stopwords if needed).
Step 2: Extractive Summarization (Using spaCy)
Why? Extractive summarization picks the most important sentences without altering their wording.
How?
Use spaCy or TextRank to extract key sentences based on their importance.
Rank sentences based on word frequency or similarity.
Select the top-ranked sentences as the summary.
Step 3: Abstractive Summarization (Using Pre-Trained Models)
Why? Abstractive summarization generates summaries in a more human-like, paraphrased way.
How?
Use Hugging Face's transformers library with models like BART, T5, or GPT.
Load a pre-trained summarization model (facebook/bart-large-cnn or t5-small).
Fine-tune the model on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset if needed.
Step 4: Fine-Tuning for Better Summaries
Why? Pre-trained models may not always produce the best results for your specific dataset.
How?
Train the model further on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset.
Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and training steps.
Evaluate with loss functions and metrics like ROUGE score.
Step 5: Testing and Evaluation
Why? To ensure that the model generates high-quality summaries.
How?
Run the model on real-world articles.
Compare extractive and abstractive summaries.
Measure summary coherence using human evaluation or ROUGE scores.
