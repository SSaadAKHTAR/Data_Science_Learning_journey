# Task 1: EDA and Visualization of a Real-World Dataset

## Description
The objective of this task is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a real-world dataset, such as the Titanic Dataset or Airbnb Listings Dataset. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights, clean the dataset, and visualize trends using various plots and statistical summaries.

## Steps

### 1. Load the Dataset
- **Tools Used:** `Pandas`
- The dataset was loaded using Pandas for exploration and manipulation.
- A brief overview of the dataset was obtained using `.info()`, `.head()`, and `.describe()` methods.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- **Handle Missing Values:**
  - Applied imputation techniques (e.g., mean/median for numerical columns and mode for categorical columns) or removed rows with excessive missing data.
- **Remove Duplicates:**
  - Identified and removed duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.
- **Manage Outliers:**
  - Used statistical methods like the **IQR rule** and visualizations (e.g., boxplots) to detect and handle outliers.

### 3. Visualizations
- **Bar Charts:**
  - Visualized distributions of categorical variables.
- **Histograms:**
  - Plotted numeric features to analyze their distributions.
- **Correlation Heatmap:**
  - Generated a heatmap to understand relationships between numeric features.

### 4. Summarize Insights
- Highlighted key findings such as:
  - Distributions of key variables.
  - Correlations and potential relationships between features.
  - Patterns and anomalies in the dataset.

## Outcome
- A Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing:
  - Data cleaning processes.
  - Visualizations for trends and distributions.
  - Documented insights and observations.
